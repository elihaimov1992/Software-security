# Suiter - Final Project


## Introduction
Our goal is to create an app that helps users choose a suit and see how it looks on them before buying it.
The Suiter application will allow the user to choose a suit for himself and see how it will look on him. The user will provide a front view photograph of himself and 
choose colors for the suit, and the application will draw the suit on top of him accordingly.
